/*
  Safeheap detects double free, unallocated free, unallocated realloc, buffer overrun,
  underrun, unallocated src buffer usage, ininitialized src buffer usage
  through strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat, memcpy, memmove, and memset.
  Upon detecting abobe cases, applicaiton would be stopped with segmentation fault.
  This makes it easier to debug the application.
